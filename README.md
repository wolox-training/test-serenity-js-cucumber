Use this [template repository](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-repository-from-a-template)
to get started with acceptance testing your web applications using [Serenity/JS](https://serenity-js.org), [Cucumber](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-js) and [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/). 

You might also want to have a look at the [Serenity BDD reports](https://serenity-js.github.io/serenity-js-cucumber-protractor-template/) produced by this project.

## Prerequisites

To use this project, you'll need:
- Node.js, a Long-Term Support (LTS) release version 10 or later - [download](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- Java Runtime Environment (JRE) or a Java Development Kit (JDK) version 8 or later - [download](https://adoptopenjdk.net/)
- Chrome web browser - [download](https://www.google.co.uk/chrome/)

Follow the [installation instructions](https://serenity-js.org/handbook/integration/runtime-dependencies.html) to help you verify your setup.

## Usage

This repository is a GitHub template. You can use it to create new [GitHub repositories](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-repository-from-a-template) or simply [clone it to your computer](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository).

### Installation

Once you have the code on your computer, use your computer terminal to run the following command in the directory where you've cloned the project:
```
npm ci
```

Running [`npm ci`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v6/commands/npm-ci) downloads the [Node modules](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-packages-and-modules) this project depends on, as well as the latest version of [`chromedriver`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chromedriver) and the [Serenity BDD CLI](https://github.com/serenity-bdd/serenity-cli) reporter jar. 

### Corporate networks

If your network administrators require you to use proxy servers or an internal artifact registry (Artifactory, Nexus, etc.), your development environment might require some additional configuration.

The easiest way to do it is to create an [`.npmrc` file](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v6/configuring-npm/npmrc) in your home directory: 

```
proxy=http://user:password@host.mycompany.com:8080/
https-proxy=http://user:password@host.mycompany.com:8080/
strict-ssl=false
registry=https://artifactory.mycompany.com/artifactory/
```

If you encounter issues downloading the Serenity BDD CLI jar, please follow the [detailed instructions in the Serenity/JS Handbook](https://serenity-js.org/modules/serenity-bdd/#downloading-the-serenity-bdd-reporting-cli).

Similar instructions are available for the [`chromedriver` module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chromedriver).

### Execution

The project provides several [NPM scripts](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v6/using-npm/scripts) defined in [`package.json`](package.json):

```
npm run lint            # runs the code linter
npm run clean           # removes reports from any previous test run
npm test                # executes the example test suite
                        # and generates the report under ./target/site/serenity
```

#### Running individual scenarios by name

To execute only those scenarios which names match a given pattern, run:

```
npm run test:execute -- --cucumberOpts.name="Adding numbers"
``` 

Note that this technique works with partial matches, i.e. specifying `--cucumberOpts.name="numbers"` would match both scenarios in the [example `.feature` file](features/super_calculator.feature).

#### Running scenarios by tag

You can limit the number of scenarios to execute using [Cucumber tags](https://cucumber.io/docs/cucumber/api/#tags) and [tag expressions](https://cucumber.io/docs/cucumber/api/#tag-expressions), for example:

```
npm run test:execute -- --cucumberOpts.tags="@smoke-test and @fast"
``` 

#### Running scenarios by file name and line number

You can also run a single scenario by specifying its exact `file:line` location, for example
```
npm run test:execute -- --specs=features/super_calculator.feature:24
```

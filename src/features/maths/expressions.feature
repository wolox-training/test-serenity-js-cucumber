# Feature: Expressions

#   [math.js](https://mathjs.org/) is available as a RESTful API at [api.mathjs.org](https://api.mathjs.org/).

#   Evaluations can be done via GET or POST requests.
#   The duration per evaluation of this free service is limited to 10 seconds,
#   with a maximum of 10,000 requests per day.

#   Rule: One expression - one result

#     Scenario Outline: Basic expressions

#       Single expression requests can be evaluated using the [GET endpoint](https://api.mathjs.org/#get).

#       When Sandra requests evaluation of <expression>
#       Then she should get <expected_result>

#       Examples: Basic operators
#         | expression | expected_result |
#         | 2 + 3      | 5               |
#         | 2 - 3      | -1              |

#       Examples: Order of operations
#         | expression | expected_result |
#         | 2 * 2 + 2  | 6               |
#         | 2 + 2 * 2  | 6               |

#   Rule: Multiple expressions - multiple results

#     Scenario: Multiple expressions

#       Requests to evaluate multiple expression should be sent to the [POST endpoint](https://api.mathjs.org/#post).

#       When Sandra requests evaluation of:
#         | expression |
#         | 2 + 3      |
#         | 2 - 3      |
#         | 2 * 2 + 2  |
#         | 2 + 2 * 2  |
#       Then she should get following results:
#         | expected_result |
#         | 5               |
#         | -1              |
#         | 6               |
#         | 6               |
